    \class Entity Set
     A set of positionable entities. Its a container, but it is at the same
	 time the main hierarchical base class for the simulation. Everything have
	 to be included in an entity set, and the links are only allowed between elements
	 of the same entity set. links among reference systems of two diferent entity sets are
	 only allowed if the spring is the whole entity set, and the father has a external plug 
	 for external references (TCP)
	 This way of working is important for classifying objects and being able to iterate across all
	 elements in an orderly manner.
	 It has dependencies to all the basic abstract classes like ^Positionable, Solid, Joints, etc..
